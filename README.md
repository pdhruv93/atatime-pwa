# @@time(at a time)

## Idea

On a Wednesday night traveling by cab, I felt how many people would be doing the same activity as me at the same time. That's when I started implementing @@time(at a time).

@@time is a simple application that lets users mark their current activity and then check the list of
other users doing the same activity at that time around the world.
